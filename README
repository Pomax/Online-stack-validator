Do you hate not knowing why some code refuses to compile because there's
"some" error with it, but your thingakajigger can't accurately tell you
where things went wrong? (Like, say, you're writing Processing code)

Use this.

It'll help you at least identify where things might potentially be wrong
by flagging still open or closed-before-expected pairs of '', "", [], {}
and (). It doesn't do semi-colon checks because at this point there are
two kinds of people in the world: those that appreciate the rigidity
of semi-colons, and those that think they're a blight upon the programming
world and they should never exist! (these people also think whitespace
is semantic).

There's also a third kind of person in this world who looks at the previous
statement and goes "I don't live in your world", and semi-colon detection
isn't in there for those people. I don't know what language(s) you use,
and not all of them use semi's.

Anyway, try your code, see what it does. If you think the validator needs
more functionality, let me know. We can add this.

License: this code is trivial. I don't care what you do with it =)
